# Ideas for reorganization of notes etc.

## lecture notes

- move the choosing and selection piece to before inference
  - add rowwise intro to that (with list-columns?)
- change all the `map` stuff to  `rowwise`, including simulations (power and bootstrap, etc)

## PASIAS

- move the chapter on choosing and selection to before inference
- subdivide the chapters to correspond better to the pieces of lecture notes including for D29
- edit out all the `map` stuff and replace by `rowwise` (in the same manner as lecture notes)

## D29 

- also get rid of `map`
- make sure all the `gather`/`spread` is gone
- introduce some new examples (maybe more realistic ones?)


## plan of attack

- start with C32 lecture notes
- move choosing piece and think about tidying piece (I think it can stay)
- move choosing chapter in pasias
- add rowwise piece to notes, after the `join` stuff
  - list columns
  - nest_by - unnest
- maybe turn bootstrap piece into more general discussion of simulation (or not, leaving it for C33)
- take out `map` discussion from notes, wherever it appears

- see if any problems replacing all `map` by `rowwise`

- split chapters of PASIAS for C32-C33

- add problems from recent assignments to pasias

- get `gather`-`spread` out of D29
- new examples
- split PASIAS for this too

- make sure nothing old left in PASIAS (gather/spread/map)
